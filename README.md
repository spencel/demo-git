A remote git repository (repo) would seem like an odd place to put a git tutorial, however this tutorial will teach you how to get this repo onto your local machine and more. Git is a source-control management (SCM) system that has free remote repo hosting such as here on github and also [bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org). Git repos can thus be shared between computers and people, and verions can be controlled and reverted to if necessary.

How to Get Git
=

1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Download for your operating system. I'm going with a non-portable 64-bit version.
3. Run the installation exe as administrator.
4. Go with the default installation settings.
5. Check if git is installed by executing the following command in a CLI:

```
git --version
```
The result should look something like this:
```
git version 2.22.0.windows.1
```
