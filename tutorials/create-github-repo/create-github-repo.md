How to Create a Repo on GitHub
=

Keep in mind that you can create as many repos as you have projects.

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) if you haven't yet.
2. The repository name should be the name of your project.
3. Add a description if you like.
4. Check the box for *Initialize this repository with a README*.
5. Click on *Add .gitignore: None* and select the type of project you will be working on, for example, Node, Android, Java, R, Ruby, etc.
6. Click on *Add a license: None* and select something such as MIT License.
